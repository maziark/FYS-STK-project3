In the age of big data, machine learning algorithms are widely used 
to make sense of overwhelming amounts of data. In the prototypical case of machine learning, 
one tries to extract trends from a copious amount of samples, but there are instances  where l
arge amounts of information can be conained in small sample sizes. The aim of this project was 
to attempt to test the abilities of  various machine learning algorithms to handle a small data 
set with a large  amount of variables.

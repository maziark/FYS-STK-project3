# FYS-STK-project3

We have developed several separate codes, which process and analyze the data set via XGBoost, Random Forest and manual code for Neural Network. We have also used Keras implementation of Siamese and Triplet Neural Network. We have unified all the codes in one pipeline, which is intended to be highly configurable. The separate codes can be found in the "code/separately" folder, and the result can be found in the "code/unified" folder. To run the unified code, you need to run file main.py, and ParamFile.yaml must be configured beforehand.
